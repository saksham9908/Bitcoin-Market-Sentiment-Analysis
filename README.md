# 📊 Bitcoin Market Sentiment vs Trader Performance

This project explores how market sentiment influences trader performance, using real-world datasets that include both Bitcoin sentiment data and historical trader activity from Hyperliquid.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

1. **Fear & Greed Index**
   - Columns: `date`, `classification` (Extreme Fear → Extreme Greed), `value`
   - Represents daily market sentiment toward Bitcoin

2. **Hyperliquid Historical Trader Data**
   - Includes: `account`, `execution price`, `side (buy/sell)`, `size USD`, `closed PnL`, `timestamp`, etc.
   - Represents individual trades executed by traders

---

## 🎯 Objective

> To explore the relationship between trader behavior/performance and market sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver actionable trading insights.

---

## 🛠️ Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Standardized and merged both datasets using `date`
   - Encoded sentiment levels (Extreme Fear → 0, ... Extreme Greed → 4)
   - Filtered and retained relevant trade columns

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Trade-Level Metrics:**
     - `PnL_bin` (Profit/Loss)
     - `Side_Binary` (Buy = 1, Sell = 0)
     - `Normalized PnL` (P&L adjusted by trade size)
   - **Account-Level Daily Aggregates:**
     - `Total PnL`, `Profit Rate`, `Buy Ratio`, `Avg Trade Size`, etc.

3. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Used seaborn/matplotlib to analyze patterns across sentiment classes
   - Created boxplots and summaries to evaluate shifts in performance and behavior

## 📈 Summary of Findings

### Performance Metrics Vary with Sentiment
- Traders perform significantly better during **Greed** and **Extreme Greed**
- **Fear** periods lead to more losses and lower average PnL

### Trade Direction is Sentiment-Driven
- Buy-side trades dominate in **Greed**  
- Sell/Short trades become more frequent during **Fear**

### Risk-Taking Behavior Shifts with Sentiment
- Larger trade sizes and higher trade volumes observed in **Greed**  
- Traders are more conservative during **Fear** phases

---

## Meaningful Insights & Recommendations

### For Traders
- Use sentiment as a filter: Avoid overtrading during **Fear**  
- Leverage momentum in **Greed** phases—but manage risk

### For Algorithmic Strategy Design
- Include `sentiment_score` as a feature in ML models  
- Dynamic position sizing or stop-loss logic based on sentiment

### For Analysts / Firms
- Monitor performance segmented by sentiment  
- Identify traders who outperform during fear—potential contrarians or mean-reverters

## 🏁 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that market sentiment significantly impacts trader performance and behavior. By quantifying this relationship, we can design smarter trading strategies, improve risk management, and enable context-aware decision-making in volatile crypto markets.
